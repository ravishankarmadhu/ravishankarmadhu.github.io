# Reading is Boring - Give me the quick sell
Anki Hub is a standalone software made by the same team that creates the AnKing deck. It costs $5 a month or $240 for a life time license. With a paid account, you will get access to the most up to date version of the AnKing Deck along with a Creighton Specific Tag that breaks down the content by lecture. 

# What is Anki Hub?
Anki Hub is a system created by the AnKing in which you get real-time updates to cards as they are edited to meet current guidelines. In addition, this will allow you to have the entirety of the AnKing Deck (36,000 cards) at your finger tips rather to give you full control over your studying process.

If you want to hear the AnKing himself explain it. 

## What do you mean by "real-time updates"?
When medicine changes, if you are relying on cards downloaded a year ago, you won't be able to get the new information into your studying pipeline. With Anki Hub, the content of these cards will change to reflect the changing guidelines and a note will be provided in the answer to explain of the change so that you will be aware of it. 

Here are some examples in the content we went over.

# What are the Downsides?
It costs money, and unlike a lecture video from Boards and Beyond, you cannot really pirate this feature since the cards are constantly updating. As I mentioned before, it is $5 a month or $240 for a lifetime subscription. Personally, I found Anki to be the most useful tool for my studying so this has been amazing for me. However, your milage might vary. 

## How is this any different from just downloading cards from the Google Drive?
I'll be honest, it won't be that much different. The decks that I send out after each lecture are the exact same ones that show up in the optional tags that I set up through Anki Hub. Your content will be the same, the only difference is that you won't get any of the updates to those cards or those tags after you download it. 

The biggest thing that might change is that the way you organize your decks will be different. Rather than having a bunch of individual decks for each lecture, you will just have the big AnKing Deck, with each lecture separated by tags. It should look something like this:

# Ok, how do I set this up?

## Setup Guide
Rather than rehash the explanation process, the AnKing has a great step by step process on how to set everything up.
